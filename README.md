# This is a fork of VS Code ScriptSync for ServiceNow (https://github.com/arnoudkooi/sn-scriptsync)
Easy Integration from ServiceNow to VS Code to be able to script in a full fledged editor, without any configuration.  I have forked this version to explore some possible updates.  Currently I am looking at implementing an index file to store the metadata for the files pulled from ServiceNow.  This index file will store and update the data - still working on deleting the data from the index when a file is removed.
